Requirements for Churn Prediction Project
1. Software and Libraries
To implement the churn prediction model, you will need the following software and Python libraries:

Python (>= 3.7)

Python is the programming language used to build the model.
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

A web-based environment for developing and running code interactively.
NumPy (>= 1.19)

Used for numerical computations.
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy
Pandas (>= 1.1)

Used for data manipulation and analysis.
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas
Scikit-learn (>= 0.24)

Provides various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, and tools for model evaluation and preprocessing.
bash
Copy code
pip install scikit-learn
Matplotlib (>= 3.3)

Used for data visualization, including plotting graphs such as the ROC curve.
bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib
Seaborn (>= 0.11)

A visualization library based on Matplotlib for more advanced plots and visualizations.
bash
Copy code
pip install seaborn
2. Project-Specific Requirements
Dataset:

A dataset containing customer information, behavior metrics, and a Churn label. The dataset should have the following columns (or similar):
CustomerID
Churn (target variable)
Demographic features (e.g., Age, Gender)
Usage features (e.g., Tenure, MonthlyCharges)
Interaction features (e.g., CustomerSupportCalls, PaymentDelays)
Feature Engineering:

Techniques to create new features from existing data that can help improve model performance.
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values.
Encoding categorical variables.
Scaling numerical features.
Machine Learning Model:

Logistic Regression: As a baseline model for predicting churn.
Model Evaluation Metrics: ROC-AUC score, accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
3. Hardware Requirements
Processor: At least a dual-core processor.
RAM: 4GB or more is recommended for handling medium-sized datasets.
Storage: Enough storage to save datasets, models, and other project files (10GB or more).
