Churn Prediction Project
1. Introduction
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses as it directly impacts revenue and growth. Predicting churn allows companies to take proactive measures to retain customers. This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn, using a machine learning approach.

2. Objectives
Predict customer churn: Develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts whether a customer will churn.
Feature importance analysis: Identify the key factors that contribute to customer churn.
Visualize model performance: Use various metrics and plots to evaluate the model's effectiveness.
3. Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about customer behavior, demographics, and interactions with the company. The key columns include:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Churn: Target variable indicating if the customer churned (1) or not (0).
Features: Various attributes such as age, tenure, usage frequency, payment delays, and more.
4. Methodology
4.1 Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Missing values were addressed using imputation or removal strategies.
Encoding Categorical Variables: Categorical features were converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding.
Scaling Numerical Features: Numerical features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure they are on a consistent scale.
4.2 Data Splitting
Feature and Target Separation: The dataset was split into features (X) and target (y), where y represents the churn status.
Train-Test Split: The data was divided into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.
4.3 Model Training
Logistic Regression: A Logistic Regression model was chosen for its simplicity and interpretability. The model was trained with balanced class weights to handle the imbalance in the target variable.
4.4 Prediction
Predicting Churn: The model was used to predict churn on the test data.
Predicting Probabilities: The model also provided probabilities of churn, which are useful for ROC-AUC analysis.
4.5 Model Evaluation
ROC-AUC Score: The model's ability to distinguish between churn and non-churn was measured using the ROC-AUC score.
ROC Curve: The ROC curve was plotted to visualize the trade-off between True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR).
4.6 Feature Importance Analysis
Model Coefficients: The coefficients from the Logistic Regression model were analyzed to determine the importance of each feature.
Feature Ranking: Features were ranked by the absolute value of their coefficients, with the most important features highlighted.
4.7 Visualization
ROC Curve: The ROC curve was plotted to assess the model's performance visually.
Feature Importance Plot: A bar chart was created to visualize the top features contributing to churn prediction.
Correlation Matrix: (Optional) A heatmap was generated to show correlations between different features.
5. Results
Model Performance: The Logistic Regression model showed an ROC-AUC score of [Insert Score], indicating [Interpretation].
Key Features: The most influential features in predicting churn were [Feature 1], [Feature 2], and [Feature 3].
Actionable Insights: The analysis suggests that focusing on [Key Features] can help in reducing customer churn.
6. Conclusion
This project successfully developed a churn prediction model using Logistic Regression. The model's performance was evaluated using the ROC-AUC metric, and key features influencing churn were identified. The insights gained from this project can be used by businesses to implement targeted retention strategies and reduce churn rates.

7. Future Work
Model Improvement: Explore other machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks to improve prediction accuracy.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or use domain knowledge to improve the model's predictive power.
Deployment: Deploy the model into a real-time system to monitor and predict churn as new data comes in.
